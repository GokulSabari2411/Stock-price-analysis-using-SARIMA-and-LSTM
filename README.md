stock price analysis using SARIMA and LSTM to find the stock price prediction
Aim:
prices of Nifty 50 stocks. The models used include Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average 
with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We analyze 
the efficacy of these models in capturing the temporal dependencies and patterns within the data, 
providing a comparative analysis based on their predictive performance.
